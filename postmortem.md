# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Caleb Kyle


## How difficult was this assignment?
Very hard, took lots of time.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
heck yes I learned a ton from thsi


## How could this assignment be improved?
I would really like some more guidance in general on how to complete the assignments, I feel like I spend more time googling around trying to figure stuff out than actual coding. I know that that's partly the point, but I wish we had more guidance. Even with Sass it would have been helpful to know how to actually install that, that we needed to install ruby or bower or some thing like that to get it to work.


## Any other comments?
I've learned a ton but spent more time than I will really be able to spend in the future ~10-15 hours. Maybe I'm the only one hwo spent this much time though. I think I could still learn nearly as much in about half or 2/3rds the time if you gave us a little more info on the walkthroughs and in class. Thanks!
